- 👋 Hi, I’m @Puzzledlady
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printing, laser engraving for branding my handmade wood items, getting my old plotter to run, to print life size patterns for my wood items.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to repair the used 3d printers that I have come into lately. Also starting out on the operating of my new little laser engaraver, that I got to brand my handmade items. Now that I have it, I am starting to think maybe I could also put some other uses on it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on I'm not sure I have enough knowledge to offer, but if I do, I am into sewing, woodturning, machine knitting, scrollsawing, and most machines to do anything.
- 📫 How to reach me I am on YouTube, and FaceBook,(I can't seem to work it well though, and I don't always get things meant for me to see). I deal better with emails to puzzledlady@earthlink.net.
